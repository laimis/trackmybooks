trackmybooks
============

Book tracking site I built to learn Python and GAE


Main functions:

- Add books that you are reading, planning to read, or have finished
- tag, rate, and reviews your reads
- tracks reading / finished dates, later used to show things such as books read / month, reading habits
- Amazon powered search
- links to Amazon and Chicago Public Library for each book
