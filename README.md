trackmybooks
============

Book tracking site I built to learn Python and GAE


Main functions:

- Amazon powered search
- Add books that you are reading, planning to read, or have finished
- Tagging, rating, and reviews
- Reading/finished dates that later are used to show things such as books read / month, reading habits
- Book links to Amazon and Chicago Public Library
