trackmybooks
============

See the code in action: https://trackmybooks.appspot.com

Trackmybooks was put together all the way back in 2009 when I decided to learn GAE. Reading is a big hobby of mine and I have always wanted a site where I can keep track of things I read. It was a perfect exercise to learn the platform. Over the years I have not changed it much, with a few minor additions being here and there.

Functions:

- add / remove / list books you want to read / are reading / have read
- search in Google Books
- notes / Review
- star rating

Learned Python and GAE and had some fun :)
