trackmybooks
============

"trackmybooks" was put together all the way back in 2009 when I decided to learn GAE. Reading is a big hobby of mine and I have always wanted a site where I can keep track of things I read. It was a perfect exercise to learn the platform. Over the years I have not changed it much, with a few minor additions being library links for a book, and a few "calendar" like views.

Functions:

- add / remove / list books you want to read / are reading / have read
- search in amazon
- links for the book's entry in Chicago Public Library and Amazon
- notes / Review
- star rating
- covers fetched from Amazon
- view by month which books were read

Learned Python and GAE and had some fun :)
